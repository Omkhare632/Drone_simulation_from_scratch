# Drone_simulation_from_scratch
hey there! 
This tutorial is based on our project and experience from our internship at DRDO.
We have worked on :
"Autonomous collision avoidance of drone swarm using image processing"
This tutorial will guide you on following topics:
1.choosing correct operating system for the simulation.
2.Getting started with Ardupilot and QGroundControl
3.Getting started with Gazebo
4.Ardupilot-Gazebo communication using MAVLink
5.Getting started with Robot Operating System
6.Gazebo-ROS communication using mavros
7.Getting started OpenCV
8.
Choosing correct operating system is most important thing when you start with any simulation
to start with three main components are Ardupilot,Gazebo and ROS. 
These three will be co-ordinating with each other to make the simulation possible, 
Ardupilot and Gazebo will use MAVLink whereas Gazebo and ROS will be using mavros.
all these components have dependencies that are directly related to Operating system and
Version of OS.
This tutorial is published after practicle implementation on several diffrent versions of Ubuntu.
we have tried to put and tackle the problems we faced
