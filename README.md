Hey there!  
This tutorial is based on our project experience from our internship at DIAT,DRDO.  
We have worked on :  
"Autonomous collision avoidance of drone swarm using image processing"  
This tutorial will guide you on following topics:  
1. Choosing correct operating system for the simulation.  
2. Getting started with Ardupilot and QGroundControl  
3. Getting started with Gazebo  
4. Ardupilot-Gazebo communication using MAVLink  
5. Getting started with Robot Operating System  
6. Gazebo-ROS communication using mavros  
7. Getting started with OpenCV  
Choosing correct operating system is the most important thing when you start with any simulation.  
We'll start with three main components: Ardupilot,Gazebo and ROS. 
These three will be co-ordinating with each other to make the simulation possible, Ardupilot and Gazebo will use MAVLink whereas Gazebo and ROS will be using mavros.
All these components have dependencies that are directly related to the Operating system and the Version of the OS.
This tutorial is published after practicle implementation on several diffrent versions of Ubuntu.
We have tried to add solutions of the problems that we faced thoroughout the journey.
